You will develop a client and a corresponding cloud-computing server that handles one client at a time. The client asks the user for the specific file processing operation to be performed and then 
sends the input text file and other necessary information to the server, which in turn performs the 
desired operation on the received file and returns the output or the modified file content to the 
client. The client program must properly display the output or store the file content, depending on 
the operation. The client program must check for the validity of the user input.
